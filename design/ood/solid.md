# SOLID

{% hint style="success" %}
_**SOLID**_ is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable. The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by American software engineer and instructor Robert C. Martin.

### Single responsibility principle 

A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class. 

### Open–closed principle 

"Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification." 

### Liskov substitution principle 

"Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." 

### Interface segregation principle 

"Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface." 

### Dependency inversion principle 

One should "depend upon abstractions, \[not\] concretions."
